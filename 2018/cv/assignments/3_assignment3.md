## Part 1: Programming

**Task to implement**

1. Implement Canny edge detector.
2. Implement Hough transform to detect lines in the image. Superimpose detected lines on the original image.
3. Implement Hough transform to detect circles in the image. Superimpose detected circles on the original image.
4. Implement Harris operator for corner detection using hessian matrix. Mark detected corners on original image. 
5. Implement FAST corner detector. Mark detected corners on the original image.

### How to ask for help?
### Contribution of each individual student
### Team collaboration using git

### You are late.

Start from now. Schedule task to be implemented over allowed period. Day after day commit and push your changes. Don't wait submission deadline to push all at that time. You can ask me for reviewing your code and identifying bugs. If you need to improve some code that already works you can make a new branch and work on it and if it's ok you can merge it back to master branch or if not you can delete it.

If you have any problem about how to use git don't hesitate to ask me. We can discuss it in office hours or schedule an extra session for it.  

Bonus for student who are active, commit their works early, and discuss code with each other on github.

## Important Notes 
* You are allowed to discuss task problems with your mates. But code must be on your own.
* You can get few code lines from internet and include them in your own code, provided that these lines aren't the solution of task problems and you must cite the origin.
* Sharing few code lines of your own with your classmates is allowed for identifying and fixing bugs. But it is not allowed to see others solution before submitting.
* Copy and paste are not allowed. It leads to zero.
* Similar submissions will not be considered. Both teams will get zero.
* Report must include summary about your implementation, sample results and issues that you faced and how you treated with it.
* You must mention any kind of contribution of other mates.
