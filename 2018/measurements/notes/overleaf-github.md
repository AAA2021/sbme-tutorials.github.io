## Introduction

Overleaf is a web service that processes LaTeX documents online, allows online collaboration with your mates, and also used as an archive for you LaTeX works. In its 2nd version release, Overleaf added support to import your LaTeX documents from Github, to make your edits online via Overleaf, and finally merging your changes back to the Github repository.

## Steps to Integrate Overleaf to Solve your Assignments at Github Classroom
