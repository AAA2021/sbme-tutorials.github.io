## Objectives

* The first experience in LaTeX.
* Using the math mode in LaTeX in writing the answers.
* More practicing on using the git and Github.

## Prerequisites (Before you start)

* **Required**: Read the following tutorial [https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/). It is recommended to practice and digest that tutorial of using LaTeX in 2-3 days.

## Deadline

**Mondey 8/10/2018 11:59 PM**.

## Writing Your Measurements assignment in LaTeX

* First, register yourself for the assignment from this [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/KrvJuRgM).
* As you did in the first part, clone the remote repository to your local machine.
* Jump to the assignment folder and open the `main.tex` file.
* To see the questions in PDF format, compile the LaTeX file to PDF.
* In the LaTeX file, you will find the questions in LaTeX tag `\section*{Problem #}` while your answer should be introduced under `\subsection*{Solution}` tag that follows the question.
* If you feel uncomfortable with any question, LaTeX, or git, do not panic, you are most welcome to ask for explanations at office hours before deadline.

### About submitting

* As you did in first part, after solving problems, save the file, then commit and push.

```terminal
$ git commit -a -m "solved all problems"
$ git push origin master
```

* You can push all solutions with a single `commit` and a single `push`.
* You can also solve each problem separately and `commit` and `push` for each problem you solve:

  * So you practice yourself with `git` commands.
  * So you realize some significance of using `git` to work on large projects.
