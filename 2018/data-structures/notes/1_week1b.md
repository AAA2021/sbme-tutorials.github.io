## Problem Definition

Recall the example of area problem from [Part 1: C++ Basics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link 2018/data-structures/notes/1_week1a.md %}#example-of-namespace-scope){:target="_blank"}.


Imagine the case when *Asem* and *Ahmed* need to collaborate on this project. Such that:

* *Asem* generates the biolerplate/skeleton (i.e the files and the main function) of the project. 
{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>

namespace square
{
    // No implementation yet!
}

namespace triangle
{
    // No implmenetation yet!
}

int main()
{
  double squareArea = square::area( 12.9 , 2.5 );
  double triangleArea = triangle::area( 4.0 , 3.0 );

  std::cout << "Square area: " << squareArea << std::endl 
            << "Triangle area: " << triangleArea << std::endl;
}
{% endhighlight %}
* *Ahmed* has to implement the square area function.
* *Asem* has to implement the triangle area function.

~~Possible~~ Awful Scenarios:

* *Asem* sends an *Ahmed* fax containing the skeleton, then *Ahmed* sends back the skeleton with the `square::area` function implemented, and so on.
* A-like scenario, but through facebook, e-mail, or dropbox!
* They pass USB disk back and forth!
* They sit together to finish the project!

And wait a minute:

* What if we have a team of 8 members.
* What if your application was as big as 20K lines of code across tens of files.

## Version Control Systems

* Keep track of all the changes that happened (No lost work).
* Many Developers can work on the same file at the same time.
* The Version Control System will handle conflicts if possible, if not, it
 will ask the developers to check it.

### Popular Version Control Systems

* Git (we will use this)
* Mercurial
* Subversion (SVN)

### Git

![Linux](../../../gallery/Linus_Torvalds.jpeg.jpg)

* [Linus Torvaldos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) developed Linux Kernel in 1991.
* Torvalds and others developed Git for management of Linux Kernel source in 2005.
* Git is Free and Open Source.
* Great community support. You can always search in Quora and Stackoverflow for problems you face.

#### Typical Git Cycle

For your first experience with git, refer to this workflow.

1. \[First Time Only\] Create/Clone Repository to your disk, so you have a local copy.
2. \[Optional\] Create a branch giving it a name (e.g your new feature/function name).
3. Make changes to your source (edit/add new file).
4. Add new files to your **repository system**. (You already created the files physically, but you need to ask the git repository to take control of your new file).
5. Commit your changes.
6. Get latest updates.
7. Resolve any conflict (if any).
8. Push to the remote repository.

#### Create/Clone Repo

* Case 1: New Repository.
{% highlight bash %}
$ git init
$ git remote add [name] [URL]
{% endhighlight %}
* Case 2: Existing Repository.
{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone [URL]
{% endhighlight %}

#### Create Feature Branch

{% highlight bash %}
$ git checkout –b [branch name]
{% endhighlight %}

#### Track Files

It is recommended to add file by file, so apply this command to all your application **souce** files, **exclude** any executable files or files generated by the compiler.
{% highlight bash %}
$ git add [file name]
{% endhighlight %}

Or, alternatively, do it once for all files (not recommended, but it is up to you anyway). Just make sure you don't add any executable or compiler generated file. In assignments, you may jeopridize your score if you added any executable files in the repository.
{% highlight bash %}
$ git add *
{% endhighlight %}

#### Commit Changes

Please write a message that you can understand (e.g briefly, indicate your changes in the repository e.g "implementing square::area function").
{% highlight bash %}
$ git commit -a -m “Message”
{% endhighlight %}

#### Get latest updates

Before you publish your changes to the remote repository, update your repository in case some member of your team has made changes before you.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git pull [remote name] [branch name]
{% endhighlight %}

By default, *remote name* is `origin` and *branch name* is `master`, unless you made a new branch you are working on with your teammates.

#### Push Changes

To publish your changes to your teammates on the remote repository:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git push [remote name] [branch name]
{% endhighlight %}

Similarly, by default, *remote name* is `origin` and *branch name* is `master`, unless you made a new branch your are working on with your teammates.

### But what is *Remote Repository*, What do you mean

### Git in the cloud

Popular servers offering free remote repository hosting:

![github](../../../gallery/github.jpg){:width="40%"} **+** ![bitbucket](../../../gallery/Bitbucket.svg){:width="40%"}

* Github is offering you unlimited repository, but in public.
* To get the advantage of private repositories, but with charge of 7$/month (~ 125 EGP). **Unless you are student**. **Beware of the power of having institutional e-mail!** I advice you to request an institutional e-mail from the faculty (maybe from the students affairs). Much more offers are free for student at Github (see [educational page](https://education.github.com/), [student pack](https://education.github.com/pack), [how to apply](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-for-a-student-developer-pack/).

## Hands-on

### Installing Git on your machine

Issue the following command in your terminal.
{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install git
{% endhighlight %}

### Registration on Github and Our Classroom

* [Sign-up new account](https://github.com/), then follow any further instructions by the website.
* You should receive a message in your e-mail to verify your e-mail. **Do not proceed to next step unless you verify your e-mail address**.
* Send a message to me (i.e `asem.a.abdelaziz@eng1.cu.edu.eg`):
  * subject: [SBE201] classroom registration
  * contents:
      1. github id
      2. your bench number (If you don't know you bench number, refer to this [document](http://eng.cu.edu.eg/wp-content/uploads/StudentsLists2016/SBE/2.xls)).
      3. first and last names.
* Visit the [classroom registration page](https://classroom.github.com/a/1jyf5WHm), and give the classroom authorization to access your personal data.
* If you find an entry in the list that belongs to you `2_[BN]_[Firstname]_[Lastname]`, click on. Otherwise, **skip** to next page. Press **Accept this assignment**.
