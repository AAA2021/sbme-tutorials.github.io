# Bioinformatics

Cell is the basic structural, functional and biological unit of all known living organisms.

Cell nuclei contains cell's genetic materials DNA and RNA that forms the chromosomes. Human has 23 pairs of chromosomes. Genome is distributed along these chromosomes.

DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic acids. DNA has two strands of four types of nucleotides.


* Adenine (A)
* Guanine (G)
* Cytosine (C)
* Thymine (T)
  
The two polymers are complementary to each other.
