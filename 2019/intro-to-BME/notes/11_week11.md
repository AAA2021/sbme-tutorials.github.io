## Midterm Mistakes


### Conversion 

* Kilo $$10^3 = 1000$$, in binary $$2^10 = 1024$$
* Mega $$10^6$$, in binary $$2^20$$ 
* Giga $$10^9$$, in binary $$2^30$$ 

and So on 

To convert from byte to KByte Multiply or Divide ?

### Micro-controller, Microprocessor, Arduino and Raspberry pi

**Micro controller**

Suitable for production or manufacturing

* Advantages   
    * Cheap     
    * System on Chip (CPU + Interfaces)

* Disadvantages
    * More effort to configure and deploy
    * Processing power is limited


**Micro-Processor**

For High processing () 

* Advantages
