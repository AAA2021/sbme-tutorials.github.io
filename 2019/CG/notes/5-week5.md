## Key concept 
The key concept of animation is to compose a set of frame with different poses of the model and blend these frames one after another to get the object animated. 

Think of it like video capturing. You capture multiple frames through time and view these frames in a specific rate (Frame rate).

Frame by frame animation

For example this is first pose

And this is the second pose

And this is the third pose

and so on 

When we run these poses with time it will seem that the object is moving.
