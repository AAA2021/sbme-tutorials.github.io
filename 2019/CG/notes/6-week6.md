## Texture Mapping

Add more reality to objects by mapping a picture pixels values to the geometric object pixels to shape the object.

Defining a texture wih OPENGL 

1. choose a proper image (preferred a power of two in size)
2. 

In human vision process is as follow

1. Lights drop on objects
2. Then it is reflected (scattered) in all directions 
3. Reflected light rays are received by the eye and image is formed.

The same is for pinhole camera model
