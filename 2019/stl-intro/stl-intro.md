# Introduction to the C++ Standard Template Library \(STL\)


This series of notes aims to teach how to utilize the standard template library (STL) with examples on a sample of classes and functions that should break the unfamiliarity with the rest of the STL. These notes are provided in parallel with the *Data Structures and Algorithms* course for the 2nd year students in Biomedical Engineering Department, so in the coming notes, there will be a special focus on STL containers (i.e data structures).


A challenging issue before starting to learn STL for a beginner programmer is the necessity to learn Object Oriented Programming (OOP) as a prerequisite. The first notes therefore will address the basic concepts of OOP.

Also, an important objective is to involve applications that are:

1. **practical**, in which students realize the importance of OOP in useful applications. For example, we will avoid traditional examples like the Car Factory analogy, which is a complete example that can span most of the OOP concepts, yet useless in practice, hence boring and might confuse students on the purpose of programming!
1. **biologically related** as much as possible with few exceptions.
